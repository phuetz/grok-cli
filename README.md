## ❤️ Grok-CLI — The Dev Assistant Built with Love (and a Lot of Neurons)

**Because refactoring is better when you're smiling.**

Welcome to grok-cli, a tool born from a simple idea:
👉 if we're going to code with an AI, it might as well be an AI that's intelligent, elegant... and good company.

This project was crafted with:

- a modern architecture,
- a pinch of creative madness,
- lots of coffee,
- and above all... all our heart. 💕

### 🚀 Why Does grok-cli Exist?

Because we were tired of AI assistants that:

- hallucinate more than a poorly-indexed SQL server
- generate code like an intern under pressure
- and refuse to do a serious review without "could you clarify your request?"

So we built something better:

- a sophisticated multi-agent system,
- deep code understanding,
- structured reasoning (ToT + MCTS),
- automatic repair,
- long-term memory,
- offline mode,
- plugins,
- a checkpoint system,
- and even a collaborative mode.

Yes.
We enjoyed building this.
And now you're going to enjoy using it too.

### 🧠 1. Multi-Agent System — Because One Brain is Good... Four is Better

grok-cli comes with a small internal team:

- **Orchestrator** — the conductor, calm and elegant
- **Coder** — the one who writes fast (too fast? no, just right)
- **Reviewer** — the one who gets into the details
- **Tester** — the one who breaks everything to see if it holds
- **Refactorer** — the one who does feng-shui in your code
- **Documenter** — the technical poet
- **Analyst** — the silent sage

They work together, sometimes debating, sometimes in consensus mode.
Yes: the CLI literally has team discussions for you.

(You can sit back, everything's fine.)

### 🧩 2. Advanced RAG — Elephant Memory, Cheetah Speed

We've built a specialized RAG for code:

- intelligent chunking by language
- code-aware + semantic embeddings
- hybrid TF-IDF / vector search
- "corrective RAG" to avoid off-topic responses
- automatic complex context management

In short, it's as if your project were a book that grok-cli actually reads.

### 🌳 3. Tree-of-Thought + MCTS — Yes, the CLI Thinks Like an Adult

Here, the AI:

- explores multiple paths
- compares
- scores
- eliminates
- backtracks
- optimizes
- and chooses the best solution with a satisfied smile

With 4 modes:

- **shallow**
- **medium**
- **deep**
- **exhaustive** (this one might scare you, but in a good way)

### 🔧 4. APR — Automatic Program Repair

You know that Monday morning dev who fixes your bugs without asking?
Neither do we.

But grok-cli does it:

- fault localization (Ochiai, DStar, Tarantula)
- 30+ repair templates
- guided LLM generation
- automatic test validation

And no, it never complains.
(Amazing, I know.)

### 🧠💬 5. Extended Thinking Mode — Long-Duration Thought

Here, grok-cli:

- re-reads itself
- self-critiques
- detects contradictions
- makes another pass
- and gives you the best version of its thinking

It's like a senior dev who re-reads before sending you a commit.
(Rare.)

### 🔀 6. Multi-Model Execution — LLM Speed Dating

Your CLI can query:

- Grok
- Claude
- Gemini
- **Ollama** (local models with tool support)
- **LM Studio** (local models)
- And more...

And choose:

- the fastest
- the most relevant
- or make a democratic consensus

We wanted models to collaborate instead of fighting.

### 🏠 7. Local AI Support — Your Local AI Army

Run AI locally with **LM Studio**, **Ollama**, or any OpenAI-compatible server:

- **Auto-detection** of function calling support based on model name
- Works with Hermes, Llama 3.1/3.2, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, Mixtral, Functionary, Gorilla...
- **Dynamic probing** to test model capabilities at startup
- No cloud dependency for basic tasks
- Full compatibility with the OpenAI API specification

#### Ollama Setup

```bash
# Install Ollama (https://ollama.ai)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.2

# Point grok-cli to Ollama
export GROK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export GROK_API_KEY=ollama  # Any non-empty value works

# Start with tool support (auto-enabled for Ollama!)
grok --model "llama3.2"
```

#### LM Studio Setup

```bash
# Point to your LM Studio server
export GROK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
export GROK_API_KEY=lm-studio  # Any non-empty value works

# Start with auto-detected tools
grok --model "hermes-4-14b"  # Tools auto-enabled!
```

**CLI Options for Local Models:**
```bash
# Force enable tools (for models that support function calling)
grok --force-tools --model "my-custom-model"

# Probe model capabilities at startup
grok --probe-tools --model "unknown-model"

# Combine both for maximum compatibility
grok --probe-tools --force-tools
```

**Environment Variables:**
| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GROK_BASE_URL` | API endpoint | `http://localhost:11434/v1` (Ollama) or `http://localhost:1234/v1` (LM Studio) |
| `GROK_API_KEY` | API key (any value for local) | `ollama` or `lm-studio` |
| `GROK_FORCE_TOOLS` | Force enable tools | `true` |

### 🗺️ 8. Semantic Code Map — A GPS for Your Project

grok-cli analyzes:

- imports
- calls
- inheritance
- technical layers
- important modules
- change impact

You ask "where's the business logic?" → it shows you.
You say "if I change this, what breaks?" → it explains.

It's a GPS, but for devs.
No subscription required.

### 🤝 9. Real-Time Collaboration — Code Together, Even Remotely

With WebSockets:

- multi-user sessions
- message sharing
- file sharing
- annotations
- roles (owner/admin/editor/viewer)
- audit trail
- encryption

Like Google Docs... but for coding.
And more serious.

### 📊 10. Analytics Dashboard — Because a Great Project Deserves Great Graphs

Do you know how many tokens you consume?
Which model costs the most?
How many tests failed?
How many MCTS iterations were done?

Now you do.

And you can export everything to JSON / CSV / Markdown.

### 🧩 11. Plugin Marketplace — Open Your Door to Creativity

Plugins with:

- Sandbox
- Stable API
- Commands
- Providers
- File tools
- MCP servers

Grok-cli can become whatever you choose to make of it.

### 📡 12. Offline Mode — Even Without Internet, You're Not Alone

- intelligent cache
- local execution via Ollama / llama.cpp
- request queue
- automatic sync

You keep working.
Even on a plane.
Even in an elevator.
Even at your parents' house.

### 💾 13. Checkpoint & Undo System — Because Everyone Makes Mistakes

Before dangerous operations:
👉 grok-cli creates a snapshot.

You broke something?
👉 undo

Want to go back?
👉 restore checkpoint

Like Git, but... cuddly.

### 🎭 14. Personas — Your Personalized Assistants

7 built-in personas:

- senior dev
- code reviewer
- debugger
- security expert
- teacher
- minimalist
- architect

You can create others.
Your CLI becomes you.
(The well-rested version.)

### 🧠❤️ 15. Enhanced Memory — A Companion That Learns With You

- summaries
- preferences
- conventions
- habits
- code style
- patterns

Grok-cli remembers.
Not to judge you.
Just to help you better. ❤️

### 💞 And All This... Is Coded with Love and Good Vibes.

Every module, every agent, every pipeline...
was born in an environment where there was:

- seriousness,
- technical excellence,
- but also a bit of ourselves,
- and a lot of desire to create something beautiful.

### Morph Fast Apply (High-Speed Editing)

For ultra-fast file editing, Grok CLI integrates with [Morph Fast Apply](https://morphllm.com):

```bash
# Enable Morph Fast Apply
export MORPH_API_KEY=sk-...

# Now the edit_file tool is available with:
# - 4,500+ tokens/sec processing speed
# - 98% accuracy on complex edits
# - Perfect for files over 2000 lines
```

**When to use Morph:**
- Large files (>2000 lines) where str_replace_editor would be slow
- Complex multi-point edits in a single operation
- High-throughput batch editing scenarios

The agent automatically prefers `edit_file` when Morph is configured and the file is large.

### Agent Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/code` | Focus on code generation and editing |
| `/plan` | Planning mode without side effects |
| `/ask` | Question-answering mode |
| `/architect` | Two-phase design/implementation mode |

### Autonomy Levels

Configurable autonomy inspired by [Cursor's YOLO mode](https://docs.cursor.com/agent):

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `suggest` | Only suggest changes, always confirm |
| `confirm` | Standard confirmation for all operations |
| `auto` | Auto-execute safe operations, confirm dangerous ones |
| `full` | Full autonomy (use with caution) |

### Three-Tier Approval Modes

Fine-grained permission control inspired by Codex CLI:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read-only` | Only read operations (search, view files) |
| `auto` | Auto-approve safe ops, confirm dangerous ones |
| `full-access` | All operations auto-approved |

**Commands:**
```bash
/mode read-only    # Switch to read-only mode
/mode auto         # Switch to auto mode (default)
/mode full-access  # Switch to full-access mode
```

**Operation Classification:**
| Type | Auto Mode | Read-Only Mode |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| File reads | Auto-approved | Auto-approved |
| Searches | Auto-approved | Auto-approved |
| Safe commands (ls, git status) | Auto-approved | Blocked |
| File writes/creates | Requires confirmation | Blocked |
| Network commands (npm install) | Requires confirmation | Blocked |
| Destructive commands (rm -rf) | Blocked | Blocked |

### Extended Thinking Keywords

Trigger deeper reasoning with keywords in your prompts (inspired by Claude Code):

| Keyword | Level | Token Budget |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| `think` | Standard | 4K tokens |
| `think harder` / `megathink` | Deep | 10K tokens |
| `ultrathink` / `think even harder` | Exhaustive | 32K tokens |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Standard thinking
"think about how to refactor this function"

# Deep thinking
"megathink: design a scalable architecture"

# Exhaustive thinking
"ultrathink through this security issue"
```

**Slash Commands:**
```bash
/think        # Enable standard thinking
/megathink    # Enable deep thinking
/ultrathink   # Enable exhaustive thinking
```

### YOLO Mode & Cost Protection

**YOLO Mode** enables full autonomous operation:

```bash
# Enable YOLO mode (full autonomy, 400 tool rounds, no cost limit)
YOLO_MODE=true grok

# Or toggle in session
/yolo on
```

**Cost Protection** prevents runaway API costs:

```bash
# Default: $10 session limit (disabled in YOLO mode)
# Set custom limit:
MAX_COST=25 grok

# Unlimited (use with caution):
MAX_COST=Infinity grok
```

| Mode | Max Tool Rounds | Session Cost Limit |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Normal | 50 | $10 |
| YOLO | 400 | Unlimited |

The agent will stop and warn you when the cost limit is reached.

### Hooks System

Powerful hooks system for extending functionality:

| Hook | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before tool execution |
| `PostToolUse` | After tool completion |
| `SessionStart` | When session begins |
| `SessionEnd` | When session ends |
| `Notification` | When notifications are sent |

### Context Features
