## What is Code Buddy?

Code Buddy is an open-source multi-provider AI coding agent that runs in your terminal. It supports **Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, LM Studio, and Ollama** via OpenAI-compatible APIs and provider-specific SDKs.

It works as two things at once:

- **A development tool** — reads files, writes code, runs commands, creates PRs, plans complex tasks, and fixes its own mistakes across 5-50 tool calls per task.
- **A personal assistant** — talks to you by voice, remembers your preferences, monitors your screen, sends notifications to your phone via Telegram/Discord/Slack, and runs scheduled tasks 24/7 in the background.

**Key highlights:**
- 6 AI providers with automatic failover
- 40 bundled skills (PR workflow, DevOps, creative tools, smart home, media)
- 11 messaging channels (Terminal, Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Teams, Matrix, Google Chat, WebChat, HTTP API)
- Daemon mode for 24/7 background operation
- Multi-agent orchestration with self-healing
- Voice conversation with wake word detection
- OS sandbox with workspace-write mode (read-only / workspace-write / danger-full-access tiers)
- Docker sandbox for untrusted code execution
- Knowledge base injection (Knowledge.md files loaded into agent system prompt)
- Wide Research mode (parallel sub-agents decompose and research topics concurrently)
- Todo.md attention bias (task list appended to end of every LLM context turn — Manus AI pattern)
- Lessons.md self-improvement loop (PATTERN/RULE/CONTEXT/INSIGHT lessons injected before every turn — persists corrections across sessions)
- Workflow orchestration rules in system prompt (concrete plan triggers, auto-correction protocol, verification contract)
- Restorable context compression (identifiers preserved, full content recoverable on demand)
- Pre-compaction memory flush (facts saved to MEMORY.md before context is compacted — OpenClaw pattern)
- Anthropic prompt cache breakpoints (stable/dynamic split → 10× token cost savings)
- Per-channel streaming policies (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp each get their own chunking/format rules)
- SSRF guard on all outbound fetches (IPv4 + IPv6 bypass vector blocking)
- Tool prefix naming convention (`shell_exec`, `file_read`, `browser_search`, … — Codex-style canonical aliases)

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **ripgrep** (recommended for faster search)
- **Docker** (required for CodeAct / Open Manus mode)

```bash
# macOS
brew install ripgrep

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ripgrep

# Windows
choco install ripgrep
```

### Install

```bash
# npm (recommended)
npm install -g @phuetz/code-buddy

# Or try without installing
npx @phuetz/code-buddy@latest
```

### First Run

```bash
# Configure API key (Grok/xAI)
export GROK_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Start interactive mode
buddy

# Or with a specific task
buddy --prompt "analyze the codebase structure"

# Use with local LLM (LM Studio)
buddy --base-url http://localhost:1234/v1 --api-key lm-studio

# Full autonomy mode
YOLO_MODE=true buddy
```

### Headless Mode (CI / Scripting)

```bash
# Single prompt, JSON output to stdout (logs go to stderr)
buddy -p "create a hello world Express app" --output-format json > result.json

# Pipe into other tools
buddy -p "explain this code" --output-format json 2>/dev/null | jq '.content'

# Use in CI with full autonomy
buddy -p "run tests and fix failures" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --output-format json \
  --max-tool-rounds 30

# Auto-approve all tool executions (no confirmation prompts)
buddy -p "fix lint errors" --auto-approve --output-format text
```

Headless mode exits cleanly after completion — safe for `timeout`, shell scripts, and CI pipelines.

### Session Management

```bash
# Continue the most recent session
buddy --continue

# Resume a specific session by ID (supports partial matching)
buddy --resume abc123

# Set a cost limit for the session
buddy --max-price 5.00
```

### Typical Project Workflow

```bash
# 1. First-time setup
buddy --setup                # Quick API key setup wizard
buddy onboard                # Full interactive config wizard
buddy doctor                 # Verify environment & dependencies

# 2. Start coding
buddy                        # Launch interactive chat
buddy --vim                  # Launch with Vim keybindings

# 3. Describe what you want in natural language
> "Create a Node.js project with Express and Prisma"
> "Add Google OAuth authentication"
> "Write tests for the auth module"
> "Fix the typecheck errors"
> "Commit everything"

# 4. Advanced modes
buddy --model gemini-2.5-flash  # Switch AI model
buddy --system-prompt architect # Use architect system prompt
buddy --agent my-custom-agent   # Use custom agent from ~/.codebuddy/agents/
buddy speak                     # Voice conversation mode
buddy daemon start              # Run 24/7 in background
buddy server --port 3000        # Expose REST/WebSocket API
```

Code Buddy autonomously reads files, writes code, runs commands, and fixes errors — typically 5-15 tool calls per task (up to 50, or 400 in YOLO mode).

## Development Tool

### Agentic Coding

Code Buddy operates as an autonomous coding agent. It reads your codebase, makes changes, runs commands, and iterates until the task is done.

**Built-in tools:**

| Category | Tools |
|:---------|:------|
| **File Operations** | `view_file`, `create_file`, `str_replace_editor`, `edit_file`, `multi_edit` |
| **Search** | `search`, `codebase_map` |
| **System** | `bash`, `docker`, `kubernetes` |
| **CodeAct** | `run_script` (Python/JS/TS in Docker), `plan` (Persistent Planner) |
| **Web** | `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `browser` |
| **Patching** | `apply_patch` (unified diff with fuzz factor, Codex-inspired) |
| **Planning** | `create_todo_list`, `get_todo_list`, `update_todo_list` |
| **Media** | `screenshot`, `audio`, `video`, `ocr`, `clipboard` |
| **Documents** | `pdf`, `document`, `archive` |
| **Knowledge** | `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_add` — search/add knowledge base entries |
| **Human Input** | `ask_human` — pause execution for mid-task user clarification (120s timeout) |
| **Self-Extension** | `create_skill` — write new SKILL.md files at runtime (self-authoring) |
| **Self-Improvement** | `lessons_add`, `lessons_search`, `lessons_list` — persist and recall learned patterns across sessions |
| **Verification** | `task_verify` — run tsc/tests/lint before marking tasks complete (Verification Contract) |

**RAG-based tool selection** filters tools per query to reduce prompt tokens — only relevant tools are included in each API call.

### Code Intelligence

**Web Search (5-Provider Fallback Chain):**

| Priority | Provider | API Key Required | Features |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------|:---------|
| 1 | **Brave MCP** | `BRAVE_API_KEY` + MCP enabled | Full MCP integration, richest results |
| 2 | **Brave API** | `BRAVE_API_KEY` | Country, language, freshness filters |
| 3 | **Perplexity** | `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | AI-synthesized answers with citations |
| 4 | **Serper** | `SERPER_API_KEY` | Google Search results |
| 5 | **DuckDuckGo** | None | Free fallback (no API key needed) |

Search parameters: `country` (ISO 3166), `search_lang`, `ui_lang`, `freshness` (`pd`/`pw`/`pm`/`py` or date range), `provider` (force specific).

**Context management** uses smart multi-stage compaction (remove stale tool results, summarize older messages, aggressive truncation) to keep conversations within token limits across long sessions.

**Hybrid search** combines keyword + semantic search with configurable weights for memory retrieval.

### 🚀 Open Manus Features (CodeAct)

Code Buddy implements the **Open Manus / CodeAct** architecture in a structured, phased approach, allowing it to write and execute code (Python, TypeScript, Node.js) in a secure Docker sandbox instead of relying solely on pre-defined tools.

**Phase 1: Sandboxed Execution (Hybrid Agent)**
*   **RunScriptTool:** Writes and runs scripts in ephemeral Docker containers (`ubuntu:latest`, `node:22-slim`, `python:3.11-slim`).
*   **Browser Automation:** Uses `Playwright` in Docker to scrape websites, interact with SPAs, and take screenshots programmatically.
*   **Safety First:** Timeout (120s), Memory Limit (1GB), and ephemeral containers prevent runaway processes.

**Phase 2: Persistent State & Planning**
*   **Persistent Workspace:** Files created in `.codebuddy/workspace` persist between script executions, allowing multi-step workflows (e.g., scrape → save CSV → analyze CSV → plot chart).
*   **PlanTool:** The agent maintains a `PLAN.md` file in your project root to track complex, multi-step objectives statefully.
*   **Structured Loop:** The system prompt enforces a strict **PLAN → THINK → CODE → OBSERVE → UPDATE** cognitive cycle to prevent chaotic behavior.

**Phase 3: Wide Research (Parallel Agents)**
*   **WideResearchOrchestrator:** Decomposes a topic into N independent subtopics via LLM, spawns N parallel CodeBuddyAgent workers (default: 5, max: 20), then aggregates results into a single comprehensive report.
*   **Progress streaming:** Emits real-time events as each worker completes.
*   **CLI:** `buddy research "quantum computing breakthroughs" --workers 8 --output report.md`

**Phase 4: Context Engineering (Manus AI + OpenClaw patterns)**

*   **Todo.md Attention Bias** — The agent maintains a `todo.md` task list that is automatically appended at the **end** of the LLM context on every turn. Because transformers attend more strongly to recent tokens, this keeps objectives in focus across long sessions without modifying the system prompt. Use `buddy todo add/done/list` or the `todo_update` tool.
*   **Restorable Compression** — When the context window is compressed, file paths and URLs are extracted as identifiers and the original content is stored. The agent can call `restore_context("src/agent/types.ts")` to retrieve the full content on demand, making compression lossless for structured identifiers.
*   **Pre-compaction Memory Flush (NO_REPLY)** — Before compaction triggers, a silent background LLM turn extracts durable facts and saves them to `MEMORY.md`. If the model returns the `NO_REPLY` sentinel with no meaningful content, the output is suppressed entirely (no notification spam).
*   **Inline Citations** — Web search results now include `[1]` `[2]` citation markers inline and a **Sources** block listing all referenced URLs.
*   **Lessons.md Self-Improvement Loop** — After any user correction, the agent calls `lessons_add` to persist the lesson (category: PATTERN, RULE, CONTEXT, or INSIGHT) to `.codebuddy/lessons.md`. On every turn, active lessons are injected as a `<lessons_context>` block BEFORE the todo suffix so learned patterns are always visible. Use `buddy lessons add/search/list` or the `lessons_add`/`lessons_search` tools. The `task_verify` tool runs the **Verification Contract** (tsc + tests + lint) before any task completion.

**Example Prompts:**

```bash
> "Go to Google News, scrape the top headlines about AI, save them to a CSV, and then use Python to analyze the sentiment."
> "Write a script to check broken links on my documentation site."
> "Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to 1000 and plot the growth rate."
```

### 🧬 Roots & Comparison

Code Buddy is an evolution of the **OpenClaw** architecture, modernized for the TypeScript ecosystem and enhanced with **Open Manus** (CodeAct) autonomy.

| Feature | OpenClaw | Code Buddy | Open Manus |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Language** | Python | **TypeScript / Node.js** | Python |
| **Philosophy** | Tool-Based | **Hybrid (Tool + CodeAct)** | Pure CodeAct |
| **Messaging** | Multi-channel | **11+ Channels (Telegram focus)** | Web Interface |
| **Task State** | Heartbeat | **Persistent PLAN.md + Workspace** | Transient Session |
| **Concurrency** | Lane Queue | **Advanced Lane Queue + DAG** | Sequential |
| **Extensibility** | SKILL.md | **Skills Hub + Plugins + MCP** | Custom Scripts |

**Why Code Buddy?**
It combines the **industrial-grade reliability** of OpenClaw (concurrency control, security policies, multi-channel messaging) with the **infinite flexibility** of Open Manus (dynamic script generation and execution).

> **Manus AI influence:** Wide Research (parallel sub-agent research workers), Knowledge Base injection, **todo.md attention bias** (task list at end of context each turn), and **restorable context compression** (identifier-based content recovery) are all inspired by Manus AI's context engineering research. The **pre-compaction NO_REPLY flush** pattern is from OpenClaw's compaction documentation.

### Code Safety

Code Buddy validates everything before it touches your files:

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Generated Code Validator** | Pre-write scan for eval, XSS, SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, prototype pollution |
| **Pre-Write Syntax Validator** | Balanced delimiters, template literals, indentation (JS/TS/Python/YAML/HTML/CSS/JSON) |
| **Atomic Rollback (apply-patch)** | All-or-nothing patch application with full file state backup |
| **Atomic Transactions (multi-edit)** | Multi-file edits rolled back on first failure |
| **AST Bash Validation** | tree-sitter-based command parsing with centralized dangerous pattern checks |
| **Bash Checkpoints** | Pre-snapshot of files targeted by destructive commands (rm, mv, truncate) |
| **Diff Preview** | Shows actual diffs before approval, magnitude-based re-confirmation for large changes |
| **Semantic Truncation** | Error-preserving output truncation (keeps error lines and stack traces) |
| **Security Audit Logging** | JSONL audit trail for all code generation security decisions |

### Task Planning

For complex multi-step requests, Code Buddy decomposes work into a **DAG (directed acyclic graph)** and executes steps in parallel where possible.

- **TaskPlanner** — `needsPlanning()` heuristic detects complex requests, `createPlan()` produces a TaskGraph
- **Topological sort** — determines execution order with dependency tracking
- **Parallel execution** — independent steps run concurrently via dependency waves
- **Architect mode** — `--system-prompt architect` enables plan-first coding with per-step checkpoints

### CI/CD Integration

| Feature | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **CI Watcher** | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins alerts with "Fix it" auto-agent |
| **Webhook Triggers** | HMAC-SHA256 verified HTTP triggers — connect CI, monitoring, or any service |
| **Headless Mode** | `buddy -p "run tests and fix failures" --dangerously-skip-permissions` for CI pipelines |

### Git Workflow

Code Buddy handles the full Git lifecycle through natural language:

```
> "Create a PR for the auth changes"
> "Review the open PRs"
> "Fix the merge conflicts on feature-branch"
> "Commit everything with a good message"
```

**Telegram enhanced commands** for remote Git operations:

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `/repo` | Repository info, recent commits, open PRs |
| `/branch [name]` | Branch diff stats vs main |
| `/pr [number]` | List or view PRs with merge/review buttons |

---

## Personal Assistant

### Voice Conversation

Full hands-free voice interaction with wake word detection:

```bash
buddy speak "Hello, I am Code Buddy"         # Synthesize and play speech
buddy speak --voice af_bella "Hello world"    # Use a specific voice
buddy speak --list-voices                     # List available voices
buddy speak --speed 1.5 "Fast speech"         # Adjust speed (0.25-4.0)
buddy speak --format mp3 "Hello"              # Output format (wav, mp3)
buddy speak --url http://host:8000 "Hello"    # Custom AudioReader URL
```

**7 TTS providers:** Edge TTS, espeak, macOS `say`, Piper, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, AudioReader (Kokoro-82M local)

**In-chat voice commands:**

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `/speak <text>` | Speak text with current TTS provider |
| `/tts on\|off` | Enable/disable TTS |
| `/tts auto` | Auto-speak all agent responses |
| `/tts provider audioreader` | Switch to AudioReader (Kokoro-82M, local, free) |
| `/tts voice ff_siwis` | Set voice (e.g., `ff_siwis` FR, `af_bella` EN) |

**Wake word detection** via Porcupine (Picovoice) with text-match fallback. Set `PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY` for hardware-accelerated detection, or use the built-in text matcher for free.

**Infinite voice conversation:** Enable `continuousListening` + `autoSpeak` with AudioReader for a hands-free loop: listen → STT → agent → TTS → listen.

### Memory System

| Subsystem | Storage | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|:--------|
| **Persistent Memory** | Markdown files | Project/user notes |
| **Enhanced Memory** | SQLite + embeddings | Semantic search |
| **Prospective Memory** | SQLite | Tasks, goals, reminders |
| **ICM (optional)** | [ICM MCP server](https://github.com/rtk-ai/icm) | Persistent cross-session memory via episodic + semantic dual architecture |

**Auto-capture** detects and stores important information from conversations:

```
"Remember that..."        → Stored as instruction
"I prefer..."             → Stored as preference
"This project uses..."    → Stored as project fact
"My email is..."          → Stored as contact info
"We decided to..."        → Stored as decision
```

**Memory lifecycle hooks** inject relevant memories before execution, capture important info after responses, and summarize conversations at session end. Deduplication via Jaccard similarity (0.95 threshold) prevents duplicates.

### Knowledge Base

Domain knowledge injected into the agent system prompt at startup (`src/knowledge/knowledge-manager.ts`):

* **Sources:** `Knowledge.md` (project root), `.codebuddy/knowledge/*.md` (project-level), `~/.codebuddy/knowledge/*.md` (global)
* **YAML frontmatter:** `title`, `tags`, `scope` (restrict to specific agent modes), `priority` (injection order)
* **Agent tools:** `knowledge_search` (keyword search across all entries), `knowledge_add` (persist new knowledge to disk)
* **Injection:** Loaded entries are wrapped in a `<knowledge>` block and included in the system prompt automatically.

```bash
buddy knowledge list             # List all loaded knowledge entries
buddy knowledge show <title>     # Show a specific entry
buddy knowledge search "TypeScript conventions"
buddy knowledge add              # Interactive: add a new knowledge entry
buddy knowledge remove <title>   # Remove an entry
buddy knowledge context          # Show the full <knowledge> block the agent sees
```

Skills are stored in `.codebuddy/skills/bundled/` and can be extended with managed or workspace skills via the Skills Registry and Hub.

**Self-authoring skills:** The agent can extend its own skill set at runtime using the `create_skill` tool, writing new SKILL.md files to `.codebuddy/skills/workspace/`. The SkillRegistry hot-reloads them within ~250ms, so newly created skills are immediately available without restarting.

### Proactive Notifications

The agent can reach out to you — not just respond:

- **Push notifications** with priority levels (info, warning, critical)
- **Rate limiting** prevents notification spam
- **Quiet hours** — suppress non-critical notifications during configured periods
- **Multi-channel delivery** — notifications route to Telegram, Discord, Slack, or any connected channel

### Screen Observer

Monitor your screen and environment for events:

- **Periodic screenshots** with perceptual diff detection
- **Event triggers** — `file_change`, `screen_change`, `time`, `webhook`
- **Trigger registry** — add/remove triggers dynamically

```bash
buddy trigger list             # List all event triggers
buddy trigger add <spec>       # Add a trigger (format: type:condition action:target)
buddy trigger remove <id>      # Remove a trigger
```

| `/branch [name]` | Branch diff stats vs main |
| `/pr [number]` | List or view PRs with merge/review buttons |
| `/task <desc>` | Create an agent task with objective |
| `/runs` | List recent agent runs with timeline |
| `/run <id>` | View run details with Re-run/Tests/Rollback buttons |
| `/yolo [minutes]` | Timed full access (1-60 min, auto-revokes) |
| `/pins` | View pinned context |

**Example workflows:**

Fix CI failure:
```
CI alert arrives → cause analysis → "Fix it" button
→ agent creates fix → diff preview → Apply/Cancel
→ changes applied → tests re-run
```

Add feature + tests + PR:
```
/task "add user search with tests"
→ plan-first preview → approve plan
→ diff-first preview → apply changes
→ agent creates PR → link in chat
```

### DM Pairing (Access Control)

Prevents unauthorized users from consuming API credits:

1. Unknown user messages the bot → receives a **6-character pairing code** (expires in 15 min)
2. Bot owner approves via CLI: `buddy pairing approve --channel telegram ABC123`
3. User is added to the persistent allowlist (`~/.codebuddy/credentials/telegram-allowFrom.json`)

Security features: rate limiting (5 failed attempts → 1h block), per-channel allowlists, admin bypass.

**Pairing CLI commands:**

```bash
buddy pairing status             # Show pairing system status
buddy pairing list               # List all approved users
buddy pairing pending            # List pending pairing requests
buddy pairing approve <code>     # Approve a pairing request by code
buddy pairing add <id>           # Manually add a user to the allowlist
buddy pairing revoke <id>        # Revoke access for a user
```

### Other Channels

```typescript
// Discord
const discord = new DiscordChannel({
  token: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
  allowedGuilds: ['guild-id'],
});
await discord.connect();

// WhatsApp (Baileys, QR pairing)
const whatsapp = new WhatsAppChannel({ dataPath: '~/.codebuddy/whatsapp' });
await whatsapp.connect(); // Scan QR code

// Signal (signal-cli REST API)
const signal = new SignalChannel({ apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080', phoneNumber: '+1234567890' });
await signal.connect();

// Matrix (E2EE, threads)
const matrix = new MatrixChannel({ homeserverUrl: 'https://matrix.org', accessToken: '...' });
await matrix.connect();
```

## Autonomous Agent

### Daemon Mode

Run Code Buddy 24/7 in the background:

```bash
buddy daemon start [--detach]  # Start background daemon
buddy daemon stop              # Stop daemon
buddy daemon restart           # Restart daemon
buddy daemon status            # Show daemon status and services
buddy daemon logs [--lines N]  # View daemon logs
```

Features:
- PID file management with stale detection
- Auto-restart on crash (max 3 retries)
- Service registry and health monitoring (CPU, memory)
- **Heartbeat engine** — periodic agent wake with HEARTBEAT.md checklist, smart suppression, active hours

```bash
buddy heartbeat start          # Start the heartbeat engine
buddy heartbeat stop           # Stop the heartbeat engine
buddy heartbeat status         # Show heartbeat status
buddy heartbeat tick           # Manually trigger a single tick
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

The **SupervisorAgent** coordinates multiple agent instances:

- **Strategies** — sequential, parallel, race, all
- **Shared context** — thread-safe key-value store with optimistic locking
- **Self-healing** — error pattern recognition (6 built-in patterns), auto-recovery with exponential backoff
- **Checkpoint rollback** — auto-checkpoint before risky ops, rollback to last good state

### YOLO Mode (Autonomous Execution)

Full autonomy with built-in guardrails for safe unattended operation:

```bash
# Enable via CLI
/yolo on           # Enable (50 auto-edits, 100 auto-commands)
/yolo safe         # Restricted mode (20 edits, 30 commands, limited paths)
/yolo off          # Disable
/yolo status       # Show limits, counters, allow/deny lists

# Or via environment
YOLO_MODE=true buddy   # Still requires /yolo on confirmation in chat
```

**What changes in YOLO mode:**

| Setting | Normal | YOLO |
|:--------|:-------|:-----|
| Tool rounds | 50 | 400 |
| Cost limit | $10 | $100 (cap $1,000) |
| File edits | Confirm each | Auto-approve (up to limit) |
| Bash commands | Confirm each | Auto-execute safe commands |

**Autonomy levels** (fine-grained control):

```bash
/autonomy suggest   # Confirm everything
/autonomy confirm   # Confirm important ops (default)
/autonomy auto      # Auto-approve safe ops, confirm dangerous
/autonomy full      # Auto-approve all except critical
/autonomy yolo      # Full auto with guardrails
```

**Customize allow/deny lists:**

```bash
/yolo allow "npm run dev"      # Add to auto-execute list
/yolo deny "docker rm -f"      # Block a command pattern
```

**Built-in guardrails (always active, even in YOLO):**
- Blocked paths: `.env`, `.git`, `node_modules`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials`
- Blocked commands: `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, `git push --force origin main`, `DROP DATABASE`
- Per-session limits on edits and commands
- Hard cost cap ($1,000 max even with `MAX_COST` override)

### Cron & Scheduling

The **Cron-Agent Bridge** connects the scheduler to CodeBuddyAgent instances for recurring tasks:

```bash
buddy trigger add time:*/30 action:run-tests    # Run tests every 30 min
buddy trigger add webhook:deploy action:notify   # Notify on deploy webhook
```

Webhook triggers use HMAC-SHA256 verification with template placeholders for flexible integration.

## AI Providers

Code Buddy supports multiple AI providers with automatic failover:

| Provider | Models | Context | Configuration |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|:--------------|
| **Grok** (xAI) | grok-4, grok-code-fast-1 | 128K | `GROK_API_KEY` |
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | claude-sonnet-4, opus | 200K | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) | gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo | 128K | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Gemini** (Google) | gemini-2.0-flash (+ vision) | 2M | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| **LM Studio** | Any local model | Varies | `--base-url http://localhost:1234/v1` |
| **Ollama** | llama3, codellama, etc. | Varies | `--base-url http://localhost:11434/v1` |

**Model failover chain** — cascading provider fallback with health tracking and cooldown periods.

### Connection Profiles

```bash
# Use LM Studio (local)
buddy --base-url http://localhost:1234/v1 --api-key lm-studio

# Use Ollama (local)
buddy --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3

# Use a specific model
buddy --model grok-code-fast-1
```

**Profile configuration** in `~/.codebuddy/user-settings.json`:

```json
{
  "connection": {
    "activeProfileId": "grok",
    "profiles": [
      {
        "id": "grok",
        "name": "Grok API (xAI)",
        "provider": "grok",
        "baseURL": "https://api.x.ai/v1",
        "model": "grok-4-latest"
      },
      {
        "id": "lmstudio",
        "name": "LM Studio Local",
        "provider": "lmstudio",
        "baseURL": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
        "apiKey": "lm-studio"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Auth profile manager** — API key rotation (round-robin/priority/random strategies), session stickiness, exponential backoff on failures.

```bash
buddy auth-profile list                   # List authentication profiles
buddy auth-profile add <id> <provider>    # Add a profile
buddy auth-profile remove <id>            # Remove a profile
buddy auth-profile reset                  # Reset all cooldowns
```

---

## Security & Trust

### Tool Policy & Bash Allowlist

Fine-grained control over what tools the agent can use:

```typescript
// Tool-level allow/deny
const policy = new ToolPolicy({
  allowlist: ['read_file', 'search', 'web_fetch'],
  denylist: ['bash', 'write_file'],
  requireConfirmation: ['delete_file'],
});

// Bash command patterns
const bashPolicy = new BashAllowlist({
  patterns: [/^npm (install|test|run)/, /^git (status|diff|log)/],
  blocked: [/rm -rf/, /sudo/, /curl.*\|.*sh/],
});
```

### Security Modes

| Mode | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `suggest` | Confirm all operations |
| `auto-edit` | Auto-approve safe ops |
| `full-auto` | Full autonomy (YOLO) |

```bash
/mode suggest    # Maximum safety
/mode full-auto  # Full autonomy
```

### Trust Folders & Agent Profiles

- **Trust folders** — directory-level tool permissions via `.codebuddy-trust.json`
- **Agent profiles** — predefined configs: `secure` (read-only), `minimal`, `power-user`
- **Per-model tool config** — capabilities, context window, and patch format per model family

### OS Sandbox — Workspace-Write Mode

Three sandbox tiers for native OS-level isolation (Codex-inspired):

| Mode | Write Access | Use Case |
|:-----|:------------|:---------|
| `read-only` | None | Untrusted analysis tasks |
| `workspace-write` | Git workspace root only | Normal development (default) |
| `danger-full-access` | Unrestricted | Deployment/release scripts |

`.git`, `.codebuddy`, `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws` are **always read-only** regardless of mode.

```typescript
const sandbox = await createSandboxForMode('workspace-write', '/my/project');
await sandbox.exec('npm', ['test']);
```

### Exec Policy — Prefix Rules

Codex-inspired command authorization with token-array prefix matching (safer than regex — bypasses quoting/encoding tricks):

```bash
buddy execpolicy check "git push --force"          # evaluate a shell string
buddy execpolicy check-argv git push --force       # token-array (prefix rules first)
buddy execpolicy add-prefix git push --action deny # block git push with longest-match
buddy execpolicy dashboard                         # full policy overview
```

### SSRF Guard

Comprehensive Server-Side Request Forgery protection on all outbound HTTP calls:
- Blocks RFC-1918 private ranges + loopback + link-local
- Blocks IPv4 bypass vectors: octal (`0177.0.0.1`), hex (`0x7f000001`), short form (`127.1`)
- Blocks IPv6 transition addresses: NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`), 6to4, Teredo, IPv4-mapped (`::ffff:127.0.0.1`)
- Async DNS resolution check before every fetch

### Docker Sandbox

Containerized command execution for untrusted operations:

```typescript
const sandbox = new DockerSandbox({
  image: 'codebuddy/sandbox:latest',
  memoryLimit: '512m',
  networkMode: 'none',
  timeout: 30000,
});
```

**Auto-sandbox router** automatically routes dangerous commands (npm, pip, cargo, make) to Docker when available.

### Safety Rails

| Rail | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| **Diff-First Mode** | All code changes are previewed before applying. Users see file summaries, line counts, and can view the full unified diff. |
| **Plan-First Mode** | Multi-step tasks show the execution plan for approval before any changes are made. |
| **Scoped Permissions** | Users get only the access they need: `read-only` → `write-patch` → `run-tests` → `deploy`. |
| **Audit Trail** | Every tool execution, confirmation, and security decision is logged. |
| **Secret Handles** | API tokens and credentials are referenced by handle name only — actual values are resolved from env vars at runtime, never exposed to the LLM context. |
| **2-Step Confirmation** | Risky operations (rollback, deploy) require double confirmation with a 2-minute timeout window. |
| **Timed YOLO** | `/yolo` grants temporary full access that auto-revokes after the specified duration. |
| **DM Pairing** | Unknown users must be approved before they can interact with the bot. |

  payload: { token: 'jwt-token' }
}));

// Stream chat
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'chat_stream',
  payload: { messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }] }
}));
```

### MCP Servers

Four MCP servers are pre-configured (disabled by default):

```bash
buddy mcp add brave-search    # Brave Web Search (needs BRAVE_API_KEY)
buddy mcp add playwright      # Browser automation (no key needed)
buddy mcp add exa-search      # Exa neural search (needs EXA_API_KEY)
buddy mcp add icm             # Infinite Context Memory (needs `cargo install icm`)
buddy mcp list                # Show all configured servers
```

### Plugin System

Plugins extend Code Buddy with custom tools, commands, and providers:

```
~/.codebuddy/plugins/
  my-plugin/
    manifest.json
    index.js
```

Plugin types: **Tool**, **Provider** (LLM/embedding/search), **Command**, **Hook**

```typescript
const plugin: Plugin = {
  async activate(context: PluginContext) {
    context.registerTool({
      name: 'my_tool',
      description: 'Custom tool',
      execute: async (args) => {
        return { success: true, output: 'Done!' };
      }
    });

    context.registerProvider({
      id: 'my-llm',
      type: 'llm',
      async chat(messages) { return 'response'; }
    });
  }
};
```

### Extensions

Manifest-based extension system with lifecycle hooks and config schema. Extensions live in `.codebuddy/extensions/`.

### Copilot Proxy

IDE-compatible completions backend — serves `/v1/completions` with bearer auth, per-IP rate limiting, and token clamping.

### External Tools (RTK & ICM)

| Tool | Install | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| **RTK** | `cargo install --git https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk` | CLI proxy that wraps commands to reduce LLM token usage 60-90% |
| **ICM** | `cargo install --git https://github.com/rtk-ai/icm` | MCP server for persistent cross-session memory |

RTK is automatically integrated via a before-hook — supported bash commands are prefixed with `rtk` transparently. Configure in `.codebuddy/config.toml` under `[integrations]`.

## Troubleshooting

**API key not working**
```bash
echo $GROK_API_KEY  # Verify key is set
buddy --prompt "test"
```

**Switching providers doesn't work**
```bash
# Verify connection to local model
buddy --base-url http://localhost:1234/v1 --api-key lm-studio --prompt "test"

# List available models
buddy --list-models
```

**Memory not persisting**
```bash
# Check memory directory
ls ~/.codebuddy/memory/

# Clear and reinitialize
rm -rf ~/.codebuddy/memory/
buddy
```

**High latency**
- Use a faster model: `buddy --model grok-code-fast-1`
- Use local LLM: `buddy --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model llama3`

**Debug mode**
```bash
DEBUG=codebuddy:* buddy
```
