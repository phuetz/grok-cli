```

### 3.2 Resource Requirements

**Total 36-Week Investment:**
- Development: $240,000 - $395,000
- Infrastructure: $7,500 - $16,000/year
- Peak Team: 5.5 FTE

### 3.3 Risk Assessment Summary

| Risk Category | Level | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Technical | Medium | Phased approach, early validation |
| Project | Medium | Clear milestones, MVP focus |
| Market | Low | Unique value proposition |

|------------|---------------|----------|
| AI refactoring on FTP | No | Yes |
| Archive content analysis | Limited | Full AI analysis |
| Cross-cloud file intelligence | No | Yes |
| Visual AI task management | No | Yes |

### 4.3 Competitive Advantage

No existing solution offers:
- AI agent + visual file manager
- VFS + intelligent operations
- Cross-platform + cloud + archive + AI
